I am a Scientific Assitant at the Sensing, Interaction & Perception Lab at ETH Zurich. My focus lies on applying statistics and statistical machine learning to large medical datasets.

Before joining the team around Professor Christian Holz, I completed the MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford and the BSc in Statistics at University College London (UCL). During my time at the University of Oxford, I worked as a Research Assitant under Dr. Matthias Qian and Professor Mari Sako.
