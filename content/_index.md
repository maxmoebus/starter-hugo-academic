      title: About me
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        I am working as a PhD student with Professor Christian Holz at the [Sensing, Interaction & Perception Lab](https://siplab.org/) at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), where I apply statistics and statistical machine learning to large medical datasets.

        My research focuses on biomedical time series for disease modeling. I first explored perceived health through wearable sensor data in intensive longitudinal studies (see my [publications on perceived health](./tags/perceived-health/)). Since then, I have developed new methods to extract information from wearables (e.g., [Nightbeat](./publication/2024-11-15-bhi-hraccsleep/)) and used UK Biobank data to model disease and mortality risks at the population scale (currently under review). Now, Iâ€™m building interpretability methods for irregular time series models, with applications to wearables data and electronic health records.

      title: Recent Publications
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        Below are some of the most recent publications I've been involved in. You can check out a full list of my publications [here](./publication/).
        
        There are a few common themes: [interpretable modeling](./tags/interpretable-modeling/), [mobile health](./tags/mobile-health/), [perceived health](./tags/perceived-health/), and [human computer interaction](./tags/hci/).
        
        Most of my past projects involved [interpretable modeling](./tags/interpretable-modeling/) techniques to better understand the outcome of interest rather than simply predicting it. A few publications focus on [perceived health](./tags/perceived-health/), such as fatigue or sleep quality, and I've been a sidekick on a few publications in [human computer interaction](./tags/hci/), where I mainly contributed to the (interpretable) statistical analysis.
