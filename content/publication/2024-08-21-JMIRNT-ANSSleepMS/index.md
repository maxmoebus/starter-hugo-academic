abstract: >-
  ***Background:*** Low sleep quality is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) and substantially decreases patients’ quality of life. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is crucial to healthy sleep, and the transition from wake to sleep produces the largest shift in autonomic activity we experience every day. For patients with MS, the ANS is often impaired. The relationship between the ANS and perceived sleep quality in patients with MS remains elusive.***Objective:***In this study, we aim to quantify the impact of the ANS and MS on perceived sleep quality.***Methods:***We monitored 77 participants over 2 weeks using an arm-worn wearable sensor and a custom smartphone app. Besides recording daily perceived sleep quality, we continuously recorded participants’ heart rate (HR) and HR variability on a per-second basis, as well as stress, activity, and the weather (20,700 hours of sensor data).***Results:***During sleep, we found that reduced HR variability and increased motion led to lower perceived sleep quality in patients with MS (n=53) as well as the age- and gender-matched control group (n=24). An activated stress response (high sympathetic activity and low parasympathetic activity) while asleep resulted in lower perceived sleep quality. For patients with MS, an activated stress response while asleep reduced perceived sleep quality more heavily than in the control group. Similarly, the effect of increased stress levels throughout the day is particularly severe for patients with MS. For patients with MS, we found that stress correlated negatively with minimal observed HR while asleep and might even affect their daily routine. We found that patients with MS with more severe impairments generally recorded lower perceived sleep quality than patients with MS with less severe disease progression.***Conclusions:***For patients with MS, stress throughout the day and an activated stress response while asleep play a crucial role in determining sleep quality, whereas this is less important for healthy individuals. Besides ensuring an adequate sleep duration, patients with MS might thus work to reduce stressors, which seem to have a particularly negative effect on sleep quality. Generally, however, sleep quality decreases with MS disease progression. 


summary: We investigate the physiological drivers of perceived sleep quality in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. Most notably, we find that stress and autonomic activity during sleep are crucial for sleep quality in patients with MS, whereas this is less important for healthy individuals using interpretable generalized linear models (GLMs). We find that stress and an activated stress response playa crucial role of MS patients and health individuals alike. Healthy individuals generally seem less impacted by stress, however.
